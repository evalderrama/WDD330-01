    <h2>Week 01</h2>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When I was working on building links from an array I thought about the real web pages that are created from stored data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How slow can it be to build a complex web page, containing images, links and a lot of text from information stored in a database?
      </li>
