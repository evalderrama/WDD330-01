    <h2>Week 04</h2>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>

    <div style="padding-left: 10px;">
      <strong><i>Forms</i></strong>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>The focus event occurs when an element is focused on.</li>
      <li>The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.</li>
      <li>Select dropdown: The selectedIndex property finds the index of the option that has been selected.</li>
    </ul>

    <div style="padding-left: 10px;">
      <strong><i>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</i></strong>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Encapsulation: In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how itâ€™s done.</li>
      <li>Polymorphism: In OOP, this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>
      <li>Inheritance: In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</li>
      <li>
        Creating instances
        <blockquote>const blueDice = new Dice(20);</blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div style="padding-left: 10px;">
      <strong><i>Modern JavaScript Development</i></strong>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>jQuery library: can reduce several lines and get the same result using a single line of code.</li>
      <li>Advantages of Libraries: used and tested by lots of people, there are lots of online documentation, reduce code writing time.</li>
      <li>Disadvantages of Libraries: you must include the library code as well as your own code, which increases the amount of code a website must download. Speed differences can be barely noticeable, although there are occasions when using a library is a poor choice for some operations.</li>
      <li>Libraries that have emerged as the most popular so far are React and Vue.js.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Which is easier to learn: React or Vue.js?
      </li>
    </ul>
